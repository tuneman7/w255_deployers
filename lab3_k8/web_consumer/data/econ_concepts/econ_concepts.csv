Constraints,"The China-United States trade war is an ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China.  It was initiated in January 2018 by the Trump Administration, at the behest of U.S. business interests seeking more access to the Chinese market. The primary weapon used by both sides in the trade war has been sanctions which have negatively impacted both countries.  In the United States it has resulted in higher manufacturing costs, which have been passed on to consumers, and in China it has led to decreased industrial output.  Some countries, such as Brazil have benefitted by agricultual exports to China increasing as China sought alternate import sources.  Other countries, such as Vietnam have benefitted by manufacturing moving from China into their nations.

Demand Curve,"Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, (RCEP) unites China, Japan and South Korea in a trade deal for the first time and includes 10 Southeast Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.  It mixes rich countries, such as Japan and Australia with poorer ones such as Laos and Cambodia.  <br/><br/>It is a complex trade deal which provides free trade in some instances, but in other instances allows certain trading partners to maintain tarrifs to protect their markets.  For example, Japan can maintain tariffs on rice, wheat, dairy products, sugar, beef and pork to protect its farmers, while tariffs on technology products and services are dropped.  India is not a party to this trade pact, nor is the United States.",China,World,"South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Australia",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership,1,2
