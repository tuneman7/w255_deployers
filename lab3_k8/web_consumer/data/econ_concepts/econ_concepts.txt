Economics	"Economic resources are scarce. Faced with this scarcity, we must choose how to allocate our resources. Economics is the study of how societies choose to do that. <br/><br/>Microeconomics focuses on how individuals, households, and firms make those decisions.<br/><br/>Macroeconomics focuses on large-scale or general economic factors, such as interest rates and national productivity.<br/><br/>We have limited time.<br/><br/>We have limited money.<br/><br/>Our needs however are unlimited."

Demand Curve	"Although the phrase ""supply and demand"" is commonly used, it is not always understood in proper economic terms.<br/><br/>The price and quantity of goods and services in the marketplace are largely determined by consumer demand and the amount that suppliers are willing to supply.<br/><br/>Demand and supply can be plotted as curves. The point at which the two curves meet is known as the market quantity supplied. The market tends to naturally move toward this equilibrium, and when total demand and total supply shift, the equilibrium moves accordingly.<br/><br/>In the housing market the ""suppliers"" are either homebuilders or sellers.<br/><br/>As a general rule the more supply is on the market, the lower the price is going to be."

Market Irrationality	"The market is not rational.<br/>The market is also not a true ""capitalist"" ""market"".<br/><br/>It can be highly distorted and shaped by narratives, as well as business interest catering to the irrationality.<br/>"				https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irrationalexuberance.asp	1	2
