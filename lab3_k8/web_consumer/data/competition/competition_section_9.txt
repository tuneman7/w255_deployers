<h3>Market-Centric, Macro Aware, A.I. Powered, and Listing Agnostic <a onclick="its_alive()">Advice Module</a></h3>
We focus on a given property market, as defined by county or MSA.<br/>
Our recommendation model is aware of the Macro Environement, specifically interest rates, as such, it is not a "market chaser" model, but rather 
market predictor.  Our composite model makes use of a LSTM based Temporal Neural Net, trained on a per-county level.
Our recommendations are listing agnostic, in that we don't attempt to price a specific listing with different features, we focus rather on the direction of travel
within a market to give our users the tools to make decisions in their financial best interest.
