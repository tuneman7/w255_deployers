Prior to its fall in 2008, Lehman Brothers was leveraged 30:1.
Every time the value of their assts grew by <b>3.3%, they saw a 100% asset value increase.</b>
However, when their assets <b>decreased by 3.3%, they saw 100% decrease</b> in their values.<br/>
The Real Estate analog to this is people at 5% downpayments and the housing market goes down by 20% -- they walk away. <b> -- Collapses happen fast, and take years to reverse.</b>
