Economic resources are scarce. Faced with this scarcity, we must choose how to allocate our resources. Economics is the study of how societies choose to do that. <br/>
Microeconomics focuses on how individuals, households, and firms make those decisions. <br/>
Macroeconomics focuses on large-scale or general economic factors, such as interest rates and national productivity. <br/>
